# Goal
- Combine map exploration and wiki reading.

## Motivation
- I am a map addict. While exploring Google maps, I keep a chrome tab open for checking out random places. 
- Having a handy tool to quickly look up at wiki page of random locations would be a plus.


## Quick remote access
- Use `ngrok` for frontend, `ngrok http 3000` (Since it doesnt have the password issue)
- Use `localtunnel` for backend, `ngrok http 8004` (I don't want remote users to have to enter password or click on a suspicious looking link).
- It works, I tested it on my phone, but it doesn't work on sandbox, most likely due to sandbox's requirement of `Authentication` from backend. Throws an `Error 511`.
- Unfortunately, user still has to visit the `localtunnel` link to avoid `Network Authentication` issue. For that they would reuire the `localtunnel` link, and a password, which can be obtianed from `https://loca.lt/mytunnelpassword`, on the device that is hosting the codebase.
